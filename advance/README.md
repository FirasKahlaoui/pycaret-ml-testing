# Advanced PyCaret Classification Example

This repository contains an advanced example of using PyCaret for a classification problem. It demonstrates the following features:

## Steps in the Jupyter Notebook

### 1. **Setup the PyCaret Environment**

**Explanation**: Initializes PyCaret, defines the target variable, handles categorical features, and normalizes the dataset.

### 2. **Compare Models and Select the Best One**

**Explanation**: Compares different machine learning models and selects the one with the best performance.

### 3. **Tune the Hyperparameters of the Best Model**

**Explanation**: Fine-tunes the hyperparameters of the best model to optimize its performance.

### 4. **Evaluate the Tuned Model**

**Explanation**: Evaluates the tuned model's performance with multiple diagnostic plots like Precision-Recall and AUC.

### 5. **Ensemble the Tuned Model Using Stacking**

**Explanation**: Uses ensemble learning (stacking) to combine multiple models and makes predictions on new data.

## Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates several advanced features of PyCaret for classification tasks, making model comparison, tuning, and evaluation easy to perform.
